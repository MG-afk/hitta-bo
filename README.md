## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Backend: NestJS

## Motivation
I am creating this project to push myself towards a new level of expertise and understanding in the world of software development. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and this project represents my commitment to mastering full-stack and backend development through hands-on experience.

This journey is driven by my passion for building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I want to deepen my understanding of how modern applications function behind the scenes, from designing APIs to managing databases and optimizing server performance. By creating something meaningful, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

## Goals
1. **Learn Full-Stack Development**
   - Gain proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies, including frameworks like NestJS and Next.js.
   - Develop a solid understanding of how the client and server interact in a modern web application.

2. **Master Backend Development**
   - Build robust, secure, and scalable APIs.
   - Deepen my knowledge of databases, authentication, and server-side logic.
   - Explore advanced topics like microservices and DevOps practices.

3. **Create a Real-World Application**
   - Build a project that solves a practical problem or fulfills a need, making it useful and engaging for potential users.
   - Integrate key features such as authentication, real-time updates, and dynamic data visualization (e.g., maps with property listings).

4. **Learn by Solving Challenges**
   - Encounter and overcome real-world challenges such as performance bottlenecks, scaling issues, and user experience optimization.
   - Strengthen my debugging and problem-solving skills by addressing complex issues as they arise.

5. **Establish a Portfolio Piece**
   - Showcase this project as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills and capabilities to potential employers or collaborators.
   - Highlight my ability to manage a project from concept to deployment.

6. **Contribute to My Long-Term Career Path**
   - Transition into a more specialized role as a backend or full-stack developer.
   - Gain the confidence to work on larger, more complex systems and collaborate effectively within development teams.

## Conclusion
This project is more than just a technical exercise; it’s an investment in my growth as a developer. By the end of this journey, I aim to emerge with a deeper understanding of modern development practices and a completed project I can be proud of. I’m excited to learn, grow, and make meaningful progress towards becoming a skilled full-stack/backend developer.
